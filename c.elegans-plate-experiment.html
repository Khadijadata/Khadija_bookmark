<p>In this chapter, I investigate the effect of various substances and concentrations on the number of offspring produced by C. elegans. I conduct a dose-response analysis and utilize ggplot2 for visualizing the results. Additionally, I inspect and normalize the Excel data to ensure accurate analysis. My objective is to gain insight into how different compounds and concentrations influence the number of offspring. To demonstrate my proficiency in working with datasets, I have imported the data and created graphs. This dataset was provided by J. Louter (INT/ILC).</p>
<p><strong>Importing and inspecting the data</strong></p>
<p>First, the Excel file is read in using the {readxl} package. The necessary packages and libraries required for the analysis of this experiment will be loaded initially:</p>
<pre><code>package &#39;reactable&#39; successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked

The downloaded binary packages are in
    C:\Users\kzzba\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpgR7RXC\downloaded_packages</code></pre>
<pre><code>package &#39;readxl&#39; successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked

The downloaded binary packages are in
    C:\Users\kzzba\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpgR7RXC\downloaded_packages</code></pre>
<p>The first step involves examining the data. The information in the table below is dynamically presented, courtesy of the “datatable()” function. By setting “scrollx” to true, you can seamlessly navigate through all the data, regardless of the dataset’s size.</p>

<p>We now inspect the data types of the columns RawData, compName, and compConcentration in the dataset.</p>
<pre><code>## tibble [360 × 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
##  $ RawData          : num [1:360] 44 37 45 47 41 35 41 36 40 38 ...
##  $ compName         : chr [1:360] &quot;2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene&quot; &quot;2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene&quot; &quot;2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene&quot; &quot;2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene&quot; ...
##  $ compConcentration: chr [1:360] &quot;4.99&quot; &quot;4.99&quot; &quot;4.99&quot; &quot;4.99&quot; ...</code></pre>
<p><strong>Checking and correcting the datatypes</strong></p>
<p>The expected data types based on the experimental description are:</p>
<ul>
<li>RawData: numeric (number of offspring)</li>
<li>compName: character (name of the compound)</li>
<li>compConcentration: numeric (concentration of the compound)</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon inspecting the data, it appears that the RawData and compName columns are correctly assigned as numeric and character respectively. However, the compConcentration column has been interpreted as character (chr) by R, while it contains numeric values.</p>
<p>The compConcentration column needs to be converted to numeric. This can be done using the as.numeric() function in R:</p>
<pre><code>## tibble [360 × 1] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
##  $ compConcentration: num [1:360] 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 ...</code></pre>
<p>I will first set out my steps in pseudocoding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determining the columns to be incorporated into the scatterplot</li>
<li>Reviewing and potentially modifying the data types of those columns</li>
<li>Creating a scatterplot visualization using ggplot</li>
<li>Standardizing y-axis counts</li>
<li>Adjusting the x-axis to a log10 scale</li>
<li>Introducing jitter to disperse overlapping points</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scatterplot</strong></p>
<p>Now, we will generate a scatter plot illustrating the data across various components and concentrations. The compConcentration will be represented on the x-axis, while the RawData counts will be depicted on the y-axis. Additionally, we will assign a color to each level in compName and designate a different symbol (shape) to each level in the expType variable:</p>

<p><strong>Scatterplot with log10 and jitter</strong></p>
<p>The following plot illustrates the relationship between the concentrated compounds and the raw data counts. To provide a clearer view, a log10 transformation has been applied to the x-axis, aiding in better visualization of data variability. Additionally, jittering has been applied to reduce point overlap, enhancing the visibility of individual data points. These adjustments improve the readability of the plot and aid in identifying patterns or trends between the concentrated compounds and the raw data counts.</p>

<p><strong>Positive and negative conditions</strong></p>
<p>The positive control for this experiment (controlPositive) entails exposing the C. elegans nematodes to a known substance or condition that promotes reproduction, such as a favorable nutrient source or a substance known for its reproductive effects on C. elegans.In this experiment, that would be ethanol.</p>
<p>The negative control for this experiment (controlNegative) involves exposing the nematodes to an environment or substance that has no effect on their reproduction, such as a neutral or untreated control solution without any bioactive substances. In this experiment that would be S-medium.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Dose-Response Relationships: Analyzing the Effect of Compound Concentrations on the Number of Offspring in C. elegans</strong></p>
<p>To assess whether different concentrations have an effect on the number of offspring and whether different compounds exhibit different curves (IC50), I will conduct a stepwise statistical analysis in pseudocoding:</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step plan to identify statistical differences in compound concentrations in pseudocoding:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Load the Data</strong>: Begin by loading the dataset containing compound concentrations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Filter Concentrations per Compound</strong>: Segment the data to isolate concentrations for each compound.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plot the Data</strong>: Create a bar graph to visualize the compound concentrations. Include error bars representing standard deviation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assess Normality</strong>: Perform the Shapiro-Wilk test separately for each group to determine if the data follows a normal distribution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Levene’s Test</strong>: Use Levene’s test to examine the variability within the data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perform ANOVA Test</strong>: Execute an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to assess if there are statistically significant differences among the groups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Post Hoc Tests (if ANOVA is significant)</strong>: If the ANOVA test indicates significance, perform post hoc tests such as Tukey’s HSD or Bonferroni correction to identify specific group differences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Draw Conclusion</strong>: Based on the results of the statistical tests, draw conclusions regarding the presence of significant differences in compound concentrations.</p></li>

<p>Normalizing the data for ‘controlNegative’ so that the average value is exactly 1, and all other values are expressed as a fraction of it, offers several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, it ensures comparability by establishing a fixed reference point for assessing the effects of other compounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, it eliminates scaling effects, preventing the interpretation of results from being influenced by differences in measurement units or experimental conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Normalizing the data in this manner also simplifies interpretation, as values higher than 1 indicate an increase in effect compared to the control, while values lower than 1 indicate a decrease.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, re-running the graphs with normalized data enables easier visualization and comparison of the effects of different compounds, facilitating the identification of trends and patterns.</p></li>
</ul>
