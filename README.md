Hello and welcome to my GitHub Pages repository! My name is Khadija Zbair, and I am thrilled to share this Gitbook with you. This project was developed using the {bookdown} package from CRAN, inspired by Yihui Xie's work.

This Gitbook contains a series of RMarkdown files that comprise my portfolio assignments. These assignments showcase the skills I have honed during the Data Sciences for Biology minor at the University of Applied Sciences Utrecht. This Gitbook is linked to a GitHub Pages website, which serves as the culmination of my [DSFB2 Workflows course](https://lesmaterialen.rstudio.hu.nl/workflows-reader/).
