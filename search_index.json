Specifically, I have chosen to focus on lung cancer in female non-smokers. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer is paramount for developing effective treatments. I will utilize gene expression data from female non-smokers with lung cancer with the goal of identifying implicated pathways. The plan is to experiment with KEGG pathway analysis on various datasets to become proficient in utilizing Clusterprofile, the R-package through which pathway analysis will be conducted. Initially, I will apply KEGG pathway analysis to the airway study published by Himes et al (2014). Subsequently, I will apply the KEGG pathway analysis to the data used in my selected paper (referenced later). My interest in acquiring this skill stems from my passion for oncology. I aspire to continue my career in this field. 3.1 Introduction Lung cancer stands as one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer globally, with an estimated 1.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2012. While smoking remains the primary risk factor, non-smokers also face an elevated risk, with approximately 25% of diagnoses not attributed to smoking. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer in non-smoking women. For my assignment, I am utilizing the data employed in the referenced paper to identify pathways that exhibit differential expression between cancerous and normal tissues of female non-smokers with lung cancer. This analysis has the potential to advance understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor development and may offer potential targets for diagnosis and treatment. 3.2 My workflow Day Activities Day 1 1. Dataset Collection: Gather gene expression profiles from female non-smoker lung cancer patients from GEO and TCGA.2. Data Preprocessing: Import and preprocess the datasets in R, including gene normalization and filtering. Day 2 1. Differential Gene Expression Analysis: Identify DEGs between lung cancer patients and healthy controls, specifically for female non-smokers.2. Filtering Significant Genes: Select genes with statistically significant differential expression.3. Visual Inspection: Create visualizations such as volcano plots and heatmaps for inspecting DEGs. Day 3 1. GO Term Enrichment Analysis: Conduct GO term enrichment analysis to identify biological processes associated with differentially expressed genes.2. Interpretation: Analyze and interpret the biological significance of the identified GO terms. Day 4 1. KEGG Pathway Analysis: Perform KEGG pathway analysis using R packages such as clusterProfiler to map the identified DEGs to relevant biological pathways.2. Identify Key Pathways: Select pathways significantly enriched with DEGs associated with lung cancer in female non-smokers.3. Summarize Results: Write a summary of the identified pathways and their potential role in lung cancer in female non-smokers. 3.3 Aim of this project The aim is to acquire a new skill: conducting pathway analysis. In this instance, I have chosen to focus on the disease lung cancer. 3.4 Paper The paper “Identification of Key Genes and Pathways in Female Lung Cancer Patients Who Never Smoked by a Bioinformatics Analysis” investigates gene expression profiles of female non-smokers with lung cancer and identifies associated KEGG pathways: 3.5 Clusterprofiler package The clusterProfiler package is a powerful tool for biologists and bioinformaticians to analyze and interpret gene expression data based on the KEGG database. It provides functionalities such as KEGG enrichment analysis to determine which biological pathways may be involved in a phenotype or condition. Furthermore, it supports gene set enrichment analysis for specific KEGG pathway terms, allowing researchers to assess whether genes involved in certain biological functions are enriched in their dataset. Another valuable functionality is the over-representation analysis of KEGG modules, which provides a more structured view of biological processes. The package also offers various visualization methods, such as the browseKEGG function to explore enriched KEGG pathway terms in a web browser and the pathview function to present them visually, as shown in Figure 3.1. In summary, clusterProfiler is a valuable tool for interpreting gene expression data in the context of biological processes and pathways, enabling researchers to gain new insights into complex biological mechanisms.

I conduct a dose-response analysis and utilize ggplot2 for visualizing the results. Additionally, I inspect and normalize the Excel data to ensure accurate analysis. My objective is to gain insight into how different compounds and concentrations influence the number of offspring. To demonstrate my proficiency in working with datasets, I have imported the data and created graphs. This dataset was provided by J. Louter (INT/ILC). Importing and inspecting the data First, the Excel file is read in using the {readxl} package. The necessary packages and libraries required for the analysis of this experiment will be loaded initially: package &#39;reactable&#39; successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked The downloaded binary packages are in C:\\Users\\kzzba\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpKEvuf9\\downloaded_packages package &#39;readxl&#39; successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked The downloaded binary packages are in C:\\Users\\kzzba\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpKEvuf9\\downloaded_packages The first step involves examining the data. The information in the table below is dynamically presented, courtesy of the “datatable()” function. By setting “scrollx” to true, you can seamlessly navigate through all the data, regardless of the dataset’s size. We now inspect the data types of the columns RawData, compName, and compConcentration in the dataset. ## tibble [360 × 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ RawData : num [1:360] 44 37 45 47 41 35 41 36 40 38 ... ## $ compName : chr [1:360] &quot;2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene&quot; &quot;2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene&quot; &quot;2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene&quot; &quot;2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene&quot; ... ## $ compConcentration: chr [1:360] &quot;4.99&quot; &quot;4.99&quot; &quot;4.99&quot; &quot;4.99&quot; ... Checking and correcting the datatypes The expected data types based on the experimental description are: RawData: numeric (number of offspring) compName: character (name of the compound) compConcentration: numeric (concentration of the compound) Upon inspecting the data, it appears that the RawData and compName columns are correctly assigned as numeric and character respectively. However, the compConcentration column has been interpreted as character (chr) by R, while it contains numeric values. The compConcentration column needs to be converted to numeric. This can be done using the as.numeric() function in R: ## tibble [360 × 1] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ compConcentration: num [1:360] 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 4.99 ... I will first set out my steps in pseudocoding: Determining the columns to be incorporated into the scatterplot Reviewing and potentially modifying the data types of those columns Creating a scatterplot visualization using ggplot Standardizing y-axis counts Adjusting the x-axis to a log10 scale Introducing jitter to disperse overlapping points Scatterplot Now, we will generate a scatter plot illustrating the data across various components and concentrations. The compConcentration will be represented on the x-axis, while the RawData counts will be depicted on the y-axis. Additionally, we will assign a color to each level in compName and designate a different symbol (shape) to each level in the expType variable: ## [1] &quot;experiment&quot; &quot;controlPositive&quot; &quot;controlNegative&quot; &quot;controlVehicleA&quot; Scatterplot with log10 and jitter The following plot illustrates the relationship between the concentrated compounds and the raw data counts. To provide a clearer view, a log10 transformation has been applied to the x-axis, aiding in better visualization of data variability. Additionally, jittering has been applied to reduce point overlap, enhancing the visibility of individual data points. These adjustments improve the readability of the plot and aid in identifying patterns or trends between the concentrated compounds and the raw data counts. Positive and negative conditions The positive control for this experiment entails exposing the C. elegans nematodes to a known substance or condition that promotes reproduction, such as a favorable nutrient source or a substance known for its reproductive effects on C. elegans.In this experiment, that would be ethanol. The negative control for this experiment involves exposing the nematodes to an environment or substance that has no effect on their reproduction, such as a neutral or untreated control solution without any bioactive substances. In this experiment that would be S-medium. Assessment of Dose-Response Relationships: Analyzing the Effect of Compound Concentrations on the Number of Offspring in C. elegans To assess whether different concentrations have an effect on the number of offspring and whether different compounds exhibit different curves (IC50), I will conduct a stepwise statistical analysis in pseudocoding: Here’s a step-by-step plan to identify statistical differences in compound concentrations in pseudocoding: Load the Data: Begin by loading the dataset containing compound concentrations. Filter Concentrations per Compound: Segment the data to isolate concentrations for each compound. Plot the Data: Create a bar graph to visualize the compound concentrations. Include error bars representing standard deviation. Assess Normality: Perform the Shapiro-Wilk test separately for each group to determine if the data follows a normal distribution. Conduct Levene’s Test: Use Levene’s test to examine the variability within the data. Perform ANOVA Test: Execute an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to assess if there are statistically significant differences among the groups. Conduct Post Hoc Tests (if ANOVA is significant): If the ANOVA test indicates significance, perform post hoc tests such as Tukey’s HSD or Bonferroni correction to identify specific group differences. Draw Conclusion: Based on the results of the statistical tests, draw conclusions regarding the presence of significant differences in compound concentrations. Normalizing the ‘controlNegative’ data and plotting ## [1] NA Normalizing the data for ‘controlNegative’ so that the average value is exactly 1, and all other values are expressed as a fraction of it, offers several advantages: Firstly, it ensures comparability by establishing a fixed reference point for assessing the effects of other compounds. Additionally, it eliminates scaling effects, preventing the interpretation of results from being influenced by differences in measurement units or experimental conditions. Normalizing the data in this manner also simplifies interpretation, as values higher than 1 indicate an increase in effect compared to the control, while values lower than 1 indicate a decrease. Finally, re-running the graphs with normalized data enables easier visualization and comparison of the effects of different compounds, facilitating the identification of trends and patterns.

Sharing transparent data enables others to replicate and verify the results. This is achieved by adhering to criteria such as explicitly stating the research objective, making data and code available, and indicating ethical considerations and funding sources. Adhering to these criteria increases reliability and strengthens confidence in scientific findings. Further about these criteria down below. 6.1 Choosing the right article One of the skills I have acquired is assessing an article based on its reproducibility. To demonstrate my proficiency in evaluating reproducibility, I have chosen a primary article from Pubmed, “Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis” by Chiharu Sogawa et al (2020), which you can find here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32102440/. This article explores the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer therapy using a tumoroid-based screening system. The study finds that benztropine inhibits tumor formation, cancer cell survival, MMP9 promoter activity, and oncogenic signaling transducers, including STAT3, NF-κB, and β-catenin, as well as cancer stem cell properties (see figure 6.1). By evaluating this paper against the transparency criteria, we seek to assess its reproducibility and contribute to the ongoing discourse on scientific integrity and transparency. Figure 6.1: Tumor growth, migration, invasion, and stemness are crucial for aggressive cancers, driven by oncogenic signaling through STAT3, NF-κB, and β-catenin, activating MMP9.

Binary 6.4 Score article based on the criteria I’ll start with some general information of the article, then will go further into details as I go through each criteria and rate the article. 6.4.1 General aim The study aims to repurpose drugs for anticancer therapy using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. Benztropine emerges as the most effective compound, showing potential in inhibiting tumor progression both in vitro and in vivo. The research also investigates benztropine’s mechanism of action in targeting cancer cells and suppressing key pro-tumorigenic signaling pathways. 6.4.2 Methodology The methods involved culturing cancer cell lines, including LuM1/m9 and HCT116 cells, and conducting a tumoroid-based multiplex reporter assay to evaluate drug effects. Chemicals like benztropine mesylate were used. Various assays, including cell viability, wound healing, and migration/invasion assays, were performed to assess drug efficacy. Protein and gene expression analyses were conducted to understand the mechanisms of action. Tumor allograft and circulating tumor cell analysis in mice were also performed. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine significance. 6.4.3 Results The research findings demonstrate that Benz, a compound potentially targeting tumorigenicity, MMP-driven metastatic potential, and cancer cell survival, was identified through a tumoroid-based multiplex screening. Benz, along with Benztropine, showed significant inhibition of tumoroid growth, MMP9 promoter activity, and cancer cell survival, with Benz also inhibiting metastatic cancer cell migration and invasion by suppressing MMP9 expression. These effects were further confirmed in a mouse model, where Benz suppressed tumor growth, circulating tumor cell formation, and lung metastasis. Clinically, genetic analysis data suggest that changes in DAT/SLC6A3 gene expression may be associated with poorer prognosis in various forms of cancer, making it a potential target for therapies like Benz. 6.4.4 Funding The research for the article was supported by JSPS KAKENHI, grant numbers 17K11643 (CS, TE), JP17K11642 (TE), JP17K17895 (YO), JP17K11669 (TE, CS), JP18K09789-KN (TE), and JP17K11689 (NS), 19H04051-HO (TE), 19H03817-MT (MT, TE), Suzuki Kenzo Memorial Foundation (TE), and by Ryobi Teien Memorial Foundation (TE, CS, KO). 6.4.5 Availability The article offers in insight in the article views after its publish date.

These types of articles show their code and how they got to their data. Here, I will try to reproduce the data visuals in a chosen paper. I have chosen the paper “Infection fatality rate of COVID-19 in community-dwelling elderly populations” by Cathrine Axfors John P.A. Ioannidis (2022). This article investigates the infection fatality ratio (IFR) of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in community-dwelling elderly populations and other age groups based on seroprevalence studies. The aim of the research was to estimate the IFR and examine the influence of age and other factors on the risk of mortality from COVID-19. The study included seroprevalence studies from 2020 focusing on participants aged 70 and older and was conducted in various countries, primarily in high-income countries. Findings suggest that the IFR of COVID-19 in community-dwelling elderly populations is lower than previously reported. I decided to recreate figure 1A and 1B. The code used to make figure 1 is fairly readable.Commentary in the code explains variables and the logic behind calculations, enhancing readability and comprehension. The comments are clear and really help with identifying which codes are relevant for making figure 1. I collected all the relevant codes for making figure 1A and 1B, the output is the figure saved in a pdf format (can be found in my repository under “Raw-data/reproducibility” as well as the Rmd file of the script). Figure 6.6: a) Calculates infection fatality rates (IFRs) in elderly, considering unmeasured antibody types. b) Estimates IFRs in community-dwelling elderly with 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for test performance and population distribution.
