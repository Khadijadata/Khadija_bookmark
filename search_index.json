I aspire to specialize in cancer research, delving into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer and seeking new insights that may lead to more effective treatment strategies. In the future, I aim to leverage my acquired knowledge and experience to contribute to scientific research within a research institution or company, with the goal of improving the health and quality of life of individuals. I envision myself working within a research group where I am involved in both laboratory work and data analysis. As the next step in my development, I am keen to delve into pathway analysis. This decision is driven by my interest in cancer research and my desire to further specialize in bioinformatics. By learning pathway analysis, I hope to gain a better understanding of the complex interactions between genes, proteins, and metabolites in biological processes. With this skill, I aim to study the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer development and progression, thereby obtaining new insights that may contribute to the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cancer. "],["pathway-analysis-using-clusterprofile-r-package.html", "2 Pathway Analysis using ClusterProfile-R package 2.1 Introduction 2.2 My workflow 2.3 Aim of this project 2.4 Paper 2.5 Clusterprofiler package", " 2 Pathway Analysis using ClusterProfile-R package For my independent project, I am dedicating my time to learning a new skill: conducting pathway analysis. Specifically, I have chosen to focus on lung cancer in female non-smokers. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer is paramount for developing effective treatments. The plan is to experiment with KEGG pathway analysis on various datasets to become proficient in utilizing Clusterprofile, the R-package through which pathway analysis will be conducted. Initially, I will apply KEGG pathway analysis to the airway study published by Himes et al (2014). Subsequently, I will apply the KEGG pathway analysis to the data used in my selected paper (referenced later).My interest in acquiring this skill stems from my passion for oncology. I aspire to continue my career in this field. 2.1 Introduction Lung cancer stands as one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer globally, with an estimated 1.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2012. While smoking remains the primary risk factor, non-smokers also face an elevated risk, with approximately 25% of diagnoses not attributed to smoking. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer in non-smoking women. For my assignment, I am utilizing the data employed in the referenced paper to identify pathways that exhibit differential expression between cancerous and normal tissues of female non-smokers with lung cancer. This analysis has the potential to advance understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor development and may offer potential targets for diagnosis and treatment. 2.2 My workflow Day Activities Day 1 Dataset Collection: Figure out how the Clusterprofiler works and what input (format) it requires. Gather gene expression data from the paper on lung cancer patients. Also use data from the KEGG database. Data Preprocessing: Import and preprocess the datasets in R, including gene normalization and filtering. Day 2 Differential Gene Expression Analysis: Identify DEGs between lung cancer patients and healthy controls, specifically for female non-smokers. Do the same for the KEGG data. Filtering Significant Genes: Select genes with statistically significant differential expression. Visual Inspection: Create visualizations such as volcano plots and heatmaps for inspecting DEGs. Day 3 GO Term Enrichment Analysis: Conduct GO term enrichment analysis to identify biological processes associated with differentially expressed genes. Interpretation: Analyze and interpret the biological significance of the identified GO terms. Day 4 KEGG Pathway Analysis: Perform KEGG pathway analysis using R packages such as clusterProfiler to map the identified DEGs to relevant biological pathways. Identify Key Pathways: Select pathways significantly enriched with DEGs associated with lung cancer in female non-smokers. Summarize Results: Write a summary of the identified pathways and their potential role in lung cancer in female non-smokers. Visualize them with pathview(). 2.3 Aim of this project The aim is to acquire a new skill: conducting pathway analysis. For this, I need to master the Clusterprofiler package. I will try to use this package on two datasets: KEGG data and RNA seq data. Learning clusterProfiler automates gene expression analysis with KEGG pathway enrichment, gene set enrichment, and over-representation analysis. Mastering it helps interpret complex datasets, crucial for understanding diseases like cancer. 2.4 Paper The paper “Identification of Key Genes and Pathways in Female Lung Cancer Patients Who Never Smoked by a Bioinformatics Analysis” investigates gene expression profiles of female non-smokers with lung cancer and identifies associated KEGG pathways:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6329865/. 2.5 Clusterprofiler package The clusterProfiler package is a powerful tool for biologists and bioinformaticians to analyze and interpret gene expression data based on the KEGG database. It provides functionalities such as KEGG enrichment analysis to determine which biological pathways may be involved in a phenotype or condition. Furthermore, it supports gene set enrichment analysis for specific KEGG pathway terms, allowing researchers to assess whether genes involved in certain biological functions are enriched in their dataset. Another valuable functionality is the over-representation analysis of KEGG modules, which provides a more structured view of biological processes. The package also offers various visualization methods, such as the browseKEGG function to explore enriched KEGG pathway terms in a web browser and the pathview function to present them visually, as shown in Figure 3.1. In summary, clusterProfiler is a valuable tool for interpreting gene expression data in the context of biological processes and pathways, enabling researchers to gain new insights into complex biological mechanisms. More information on Clusterprofiler can be found here: https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/clusterprofiler-kegg.html.

I conduct a dose-response analysis and utilize ggplot2 for visualizing the results. Additionally, I inspect and normalize the Excel data to ensure accurate analysis. My objective is to gain insight into how different compounds and concentrations influence the number of offspring. To demonstrate my proficiency in working with datasets, I have imported the data and created graphs. This dataset was provided by J. Louter (INT/ILC). 4.1 Importing and inspecting the data Right off the bat, I noticed ‘ControlVehicleA’ in the experimental conditions, which seems similar to ‘ControlPositive’ but with less ethanol. This likely indicates dilution of experimental compounds in ethanol. There are additional sheets containing input lists, change logs, and examples. I’m unsure about the difference between the ‘ExpLookup’ and ‘Input example’ sheets. The experiment tested three compounds: 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene, decane, and naphthalene. The positive control used a solution of 1.5% ethanol in S-medium, while the negative control used only S-medium without any added compound. First, the Excel file is read in using the {readxl} package: The first step involves examining the data. The information in the table below is dynamically presented, courtesy of the “reactable()” function. By setting “scrollx” to true, you can seamlessly navigate through all the data, regardless of the dataset’s size. We now inspect the data types of the columns RawData, compName, and compConcentration in the dataset. ## $RawData ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## ## $compName ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## ## $compConcentration ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## ## $expType ## [1] &quot;character&quot; 4.2 Checking and correcting the datatypes The expected data types based on the experimental description are: RawData: numeric (number of offspring) compName: factor (name of the compound) compConcentration: numeric (concentration of the compound) expType: factor (experiment type) After examining the data, I found that the RawData column is numeric, compName is character, and compConcentration is mistakenly interpreted as character instead of numeric. Additionally, compName and expType should be factors, not character class: ## $compConcentration ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## ## $compName ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; ## ## $expType ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; ## $compName ## [1] &quot;2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene&quot; &quot;decane&quot; ## [3] &quot;Ethanol&quot; &quot;naphthalene&quot; ## [5] &quot;S-medium&quot; ## ## $expType ## [1] &quot;experiment&quot; &quot;controlPositive&quot; &quot;controlNegative&quot; &quot;controlVehicleA&quot; 4.3 Scatterplot with log10 and jitter The following plot in figure 5.1 illustrates the relationship between the concentrated compounds and the raw data counts. To provide a clearer view, a log10 transformation has been applied to the x-axis, aiding in better visualization of data variability. Additionally, jittering has been applied to reduce point overlap, enhancing the visibility of individual data points. These adjustments improve the readability of the plot and aid in identifying patterns or trends between the concentrated compounds and the raw data counts. Figure 4.1: Scatterplot with trendlines illustrating the average offspring count of C.elegans across three different compounds at diverse concentrations. Positive and negative conditions The positive control for this experiment (controlPositive) entails exposing the C. elegans nematodes to a known substance or condition that promotes reproduction, such as a favorable nutrient source or a substance known for its reproduc tive effects on C. elegans.In this experiment, that would be ethanol. The negative control for this experiment (controlNegative) involves exposing the nematodes to an environment or substance that has no effect on their reproduction, such as a neutral or untreated control solution without any bioactive substances. In this experiment that would be S-medium. 4.4 Statistical analysis To analyze the effect of compound concentrations on offspring count and identify differences among compounds’ response curves (IC50), I’ll perform a stepwise statistical analysis. I’ll start by loading the dataset and segmenting the data to isolate concentrations for individual compounds. Then, I’ll visualize compound concentrations and assess data normality and variability. Following this, I’ll conduct an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to detect significant differences among groups. If significant, I’ll use post hoc tests to identify specific group variations. Finally, based on the statistical findings, I’ll draw conclusions about the impact of compound concentrations. 4.5 Normalizing the ‘controlNegative’ data and plotting To gauge the relative improvement or decline in offspring count compared to the baseline (the negative control), it’s necessary to normalize the data. This entails adjusting the negative control to a value of 1 and scaling the remaining values accordingly. For this dataset, dividing by 85.9 achieves this normalization. Subsequently, a revised scatterplot (see figure 5.2) was generated using the newly normalized data, maintaining the previous settings. ## [1] NA Figure 4.2: The positive control for this experiments is controlPositive. The negative control is controlNegative Figure 4.2: The positive control for this experiments is controlPositive. The negative control is controlNegative Normalizing the data for ‘controlNegative’ so that the average value is exactly 1, and all other values are expressed as a fraction of it, offers several advantages: It ensures comparability by establishing a fixed reference point for assessing the effects of other compounds. It eliminates scaling effects, preventing the interpretation of results from being influenced by differences in measurement units or experimental conditions. Normalizing the data in this manner also simplifies interpretation, as values higher than 1 indicate an increase in effect compared to the control, while values lower than 1 indicate a decrease. Re-running the graphs with normalized data enables easier visualization and comparison of the effects of different compounds, facilitating the identification of trends and patterns.

Sharing transparent data enables others to replicate and verify the results. This is achieved by adhering to criteria such as explicitly stating the research objective, making data and code available, and indicating ethical considerations and funding sources. Adhering to these criteria increases reliability and strengthens confidence in scientific findings. Further about these criteria down below. 5.1 Choosing the right article One of the skills I have acquired is assessing an article based on its reproducibility. To demonstrate my proficiency in evaluating reproducibility, I have chosen a primary article from Pubmed, “Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis” by Chiharu Sogawa et al (2020), which you can find here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32102440/. This article explores the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer therapy using a tumoroid-based screening system. The study finds that benztropine inhibits tumor formation, cancer cell survival, MMP9 promoter activity, and oncogenic signaling transducers, including STAT3, NF-κB, and β-catenin, as well as cancer stem cell properties (see figure 6.1). By evaluating this paper against the transparency criteria, we seek to assess its reproducibility and contribute to the ongoing discourse on scientific integrity and transparency. Figure 5.1: Tumor growth, migration, invasion, and stemness are crucial for aggressive cancers, driven by oncogenic signaling through STAT3, NF-κB, and β-catenin, activating MMP9. Benztropine targets SLC6A3, suppressing these factors and cancer properties. 5.2 Reference to the article Title: Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis by Acting on SLC6A3/DAT and Reducing STAT3. Authors: Chiharu Sogawa 1, Takanori Eguchi 1 2, Manh Tien Tran 1, Masayuki Ishige 3, Kilian Trin 1 4, Yuka Okusha 1 5, Eman Ahmed Taha 1 6, Yanyin Lu 1, Hotaka Kawai 7, Norio Sogawa 8, Masaharu Takigawa 2, Stuart K Calderwood 5, Kuniaki Okamoto 1, Ken-Ichi Kozaki 1. 5.3 Transparicy criteria To determine the reproducibility of this article, we evaluate it against the transparency criteria. I’ll start with some general information of the article, then will go further into details as I go through each criteria and rate the article. 5.3.1 General aim The study aims to repurpose drugs for anticancer therapy using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. Benztropine emerges as the most effective compound, showing potential in inhibiting tumor progression both in vitro and in vivo. The research also investigates benztropine’s mechanism of action in targeting cancer cells and suppressing key pro-tumorigenic signaling pathways. 5.3.2 Methodology The methods involved culturing cancer cell lines, including LuM1/m9 and HCT116 cells, and conducting a tumoroid-based multiplex reporter assay to evaluate drug effects. Chemicals like benztropine mesylate were used. Various assays, including cell viability, wound healing, and migration/invasion assays, were performed to assess drug efficacy. Protein and gene expression analyses were conducted to understand the mechanisms of action. Tumor allograft and circulating tumor cell analysis in mice were also performed. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine significance. 5.3.3 Results The research findings demonstrate that Benz, a compound potentially targeting tumorigenicity, MMP-driven metastatic potential, and cancer cell survival, was identified through a tumoroid-based multiplex screening. Benz, along with Benztropine, showed significant inhibition of tumoroid growth, MMP9 promoter activity, and cancer cell survival, with Benz also inhibiting metastatic cancer cell migration and invasion by suppressing MMP9 expression. These effects were further confirmed in a mouse model, where Benz suppressed tumor growth, circulating tumor cell formation, and lung metastasis. Clinically, genetic analysis data suggest that changes in DAT/SLC6A3 gene expression may be associated with poorer prognosis in various forms of cancer, making it a potential target for therapies like Benz. Now that I have gone over the most important aspects of the article, the rating is as follows: Transparency_Criteria Definition Response_Type Study Purpose A concise statement in the introduction of the article, often in the last paragraph, that establishes the reason the research was conducted. Also called the study objective. Yes Data Availability Statement A statement, in an individual section offset from the main body of text, that explains how or if one can access a study’s data. The title of the section may vary, but it must explicitly mention data; it is therefore distinct from a supplementary materials section. No Data Location Where the article’s data can be accessed, either raw or processed. link to processed data Study Location Author has stated in the methods section where the study took place or the data’s country/region of origin. Yes Author Review The professionalism of the contact information that the author has provided in the manuscript. No Ethics Statement A statement within the manuscript indicating any ethical concerns, including the presence of sensitive data. No Funding Statement A statement within the manuscript indicating whether or not the authors received funding for their research. Yes Code Availability Authors have shared access to the most updated code that they used in their study, including code used for analysis. No That gives the article a score of 4/8. 5.4 Conlusion From this score of 4/8, we can deduce that the article has adhered to some transparency criteria, but there is also room for improvement in other areas. The findings are as follows: Positive points: The article clearly stated the purpose of the study (Study Purpose). The location of the study is mentioned in the methods section (Study Location). It is indicated that the authors received funding for their research (Funding Statement). Areas for improvement: No data availability statement was provided (Data Availability Statement). The professional review of the author’s contact information is missing (Author Review). There is no ethical statement included in the article (Ethics Statement). The availability of the code used in the research has not been shared (Code Availability). 5.5 Reproducing the visuals of a paper In Data Science, it’s important to know how to know your way around Open Articles. These types of articles show their code and how they got to their data. Here, I will try to reproduce the data visuals in a chosen paper. I have chosen the paper “Infection fatality rate of COVID-19 in community-dwelling elderly populations” by Cathrine Axfors John P.A. Ioannidis (2022). This article investigates the infection fatality ratio (IFR) of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in community-dwelling elderly populations and other age groups based on seroprevalence studies. The aim of the research was to estimate the IFR and examine the influence of age and other factors on the risk of mortality from COVID-19. The study included seroprevalence studies from 2020 focusing on participants aged 70 and older and was conducted in various countries, primarily in high-income countries. Findings suggest that the IFR of COVID-19 in community-dwelling elderly populations is lower than previously reported. 5.5.1 The code I decided to recreate figure 1A and 1B (see figure 6.2 and 6.3). The code used to make figure 1 is fairly readable. Commentary in the code explains variables and the logic behind calculations, enhancing readability and comprehension. The comments are clear and really help with identifying which codes are relevant for making figure 1. I collected all the relevant codes for making figure 1A and 1B, the output is the figure saved in a pdf format (can be found in my repository under “Raw-data/reproducibility” as well as the Rmd file of the script). Figure 5.2: a) Calculates infection fatality rates (IFRs) in elderly, considering unmeasured antibody types. b) Estimates IFRs in community-dwelling elderly with 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for test performance and population distribution. Figure 5.3: a) Calculates infection fatality rates (IFRs) in elderly, considering unmeasured antibody types. b) Estimates IFRs in community-dwelling elderly with 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for test performance and population distribution. "],["r-package.html", "6 R-package 6.1 The Demo 6.2 R-markdown driven development 6.3 Package “HanaahRTidy”", " 6 R-package Creating an R package organizes your code, data, and documentation into a cohesive structure, greatly enhancing reproducibility, sharing, and collaboration. This professional approach ensures that your work is easy to maintain and extend, making it valuable for future projects and the broader data science community. By packaging your work, you not only streamline your own workflow but also contribute useful tools to others. In this chapter, the previous chapters will be analysed to check for any repetitive code. This code will be turned into functions, combined into my first R package. 6.1 The Demo To start creating the R package, the “The Whole Game” demo by Hadley Wickham was followed. This demo provided a comprehensive guide to setting up the package, connecting it to Git, and writing the first function. It covered useful packages such as roxygen2 and testthat. A brief summary of the packages and functions was created based on what I learned in the demo for future reference. 6.2 R-markdown driven development The “Start with RMarkdown” approach involves beginning with a pre-written RMarkdown file and its scripts, rather than starting from scratch. Creating a complete all-in-one package from an RMarkdown-based analysis has many advantages for reproducibility. Typically, sharing involves an RMarkdown file, functions, tidy data, the steps to tidy the data, the analysis, and the used packages. Combining these elements into an R package streamlines the process, making it easier to share and reuse for multiple purposes and datasets. 6.3 Package “HanaahRTidy” The package can be installed via github: devtools::install_github(“Khadijadata/HanaahRTidy”). 6.3.1 Choosing a name I searched for a name that was both unique and held personal meaning. After careful thought, I decided to name it after my mother. Despite her struggles to comprehend it, she consistently offers invaluable advice and feedback on my portfolio when I need it most. 6.3.2 Overview package The package currently includes the following 4 functions: split_datetime() Description: This function splits a datetime column into separate columns for date and time. Usage: split_datetime(datetime_column) Returns: A data frame with additional columns for date and time. convert_to_factor() Description: This function converts a column with textual values into a factor variable, which is useful for categorical data analyses. Usage: convert_to_factor(text_column) Returns: A factor variable. plot_time_series_forecast() Description: This function plots a time series forecast using a specified forecasting model. Usage: plot_time_series_forecast(time_series_data, forecast_model) Returns: A plot of the time series forecast. import_data() Description: This function imports data from a specified file format and converts it into a format suitable for analysis.

During the antimicrobial project, our research group worked on further developing and refining the R shiny app for typing and visualizing bacterial plasmids by adding additional epidemiological data, such as information on isolation date, geographical location, the ability to add and compare own fasta/plasmids with the database, and optimizing for easy uploading. We will also integrate patient metadata and visualise them by making an (interactive) map for instance. Additionally, we want to add user-friendly features that allow users to add isolates and compare them with our dataset. There are many options as to visualisation of patient data [1], for instance a sankey diagram to display the type of antiobitica used for a certain infection. 7.2 About antimicrobial resistance Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to global health as bacteria continually adapt to survive antibiotic treatments. These adaptations involve various mechanisms, including the production of enzymes to neutralize antibiotics, the use of efflux pumps to remove them from cells, and the modification of antibiotic targets. Additionally, bacteria can acquire resistance genes from both natural reservoirs and human activities like extensive antibiotic use in medicine, agriculture, and industry. These genes can spread through horizontal gene transfer, transitioning from environmental bacteria to pathogenic strains, exacerbating clinical resistance issues. Given the gravity of AMR’s impact on public health, understanding its mechanisms and origins is paramount for devising effective strategies to curb antibiotic misuse and limit the spread of resistant genes [2]. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change to resist the effects of antibiotics. This can happen through mutations in bacteria’s own genes or by acquiring new genes from other bacteria. In environments like water and soil, bacteria have a diverse range of genes that can help them survive antibiotics. Over time, these resistant genes can spread between bacteria, making infections harder to treat. Scientists study how resistance develops to find better ways to combat it and develop new treatments [3]. 7.2.1 R shiny app Shiny is a tool in R that changes R code into interactive web apps, combining R’s analysis skills with web development. With Shiny, developers can make lively tools that work on web browsers.With Shiny, developers can make user interfaces and write code in R language. Then, Shiny makes this code into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for smooth web viewing. Shiny apps use R code on the server, helping with lots of data jobs, from simple math to hard stats and machine learning. Shiny gets user info, does stuff with it in R, and shows results right away. This makes Shiny great for exploring data interactively [4]. The previous research group working on this project, made an R shiny app (see figure 8.1) with gene information, mostly. It is our task to add and visualize patient data, such as patient zipcode, sample data, age, gender etc. Forrtunately, there are many options to visualize clinical data [5].

The benefit of using parameters is it’ll help simplify re-using or applying the analysis to different datasets or various categories within the same dataset. I will use COVID-19 data (2022) and use COVID19 cases and COVID19-related deaths. The aim is is to create a parameterized report for the COVID-19 cases and deaths and visualize them in plots. Firstly, the analysis will be executed with three parameters: The country to which the report applies to, the year that the reported data applies to and the period in months that the report applies to. 8.1 Inspecting the data The first step in the parameters (and in any data analysis, really) is to inspect the data. ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 28729 obs. of 11 variables: ## $ dateRep : chr &quot;23/10/2022&quot; &quot;22/10/2022&quot; &quot;21/10/2022&quot; &quot;20/10/2022&quot; ... ## $ day : int 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 ... ## $ month : int 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 ... ## $ year : int 2022 2022 2022 2022 2022 2022 2022 2022 2022 2022 ... ## $ cases : int 3557 5494 7776 8221 10007 13204 9964 6606 8818 11751 ... ## $ deaths : int 0 4 4 6 8 7 8 12 6 10 ... ## $ countriesAndTerritories: chr &quot;Austria&quot; &quot;Austria&quot; &quot;Austria&quot; &quot;Austria&quot; ... ## $ geoId : chr &quot;AT&quot; &quot;AT&quot; &quot;AT&quot; &quot;AT&quot; ... ## $ countryterritoryCode : chr &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; &quot;AUT&quot; ... ## $ popData2020 : int 8901064 8901064 8901064 8901064 8901064 8901064 8901064 8901064 8901064 8901064 ... ## $ continentExp : chr &quot;Europe&quot; &quot;Europe&quot; &quot;Europe&quot; &quot;Europe&quot; ... ## $dateRep ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## ## $day ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; ## ## $month ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; ## ## $year ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; ## ## $cases ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; ## ## $deaths ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; ## ## $countriesAndTerritories ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## ## $geoId ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## ## $countryterritoryCode ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## ## $popData2020 ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; ## ## $continentExp ## [1] &quot;character&quot; 8.2 Visualising the data Figure 8.1: The COVID-19 cases and deaths from April until July in Netherlands in the year 2020. 8.3 Parameters The plot in figure 8.2 was made by using parameters. We can now change these parameters to display different data. For example, let’s say we’re interested in the COVID-19 related deaths and cases in another country in a certain period of time. Let’s do Sweden from May ’til August. Figure 8.2: COVID-19 related cases and deaths in Sweden from May ’til August in 2020 after changing the parameters.
